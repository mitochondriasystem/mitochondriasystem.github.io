            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-10">
                
                
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Lavender leaves of Wisteria trees swirl into the calm breeze of the wind, coinciding for a lovely dance. Its sweet scent dispersed into the midst of air and the birds found a home with them. 
<br>
<br>"Do trees attract you more than I do?" I blurted out of nowhere.
<br>
<br>Her pen flinched from writing and drifted her look in me with all skepticism. 
<br>
<br>Trees will always be my rival, I reckoned.
<br>
<br>It was a holiday, and I chose to take her out for a walk like most gentlemen do.  The balmy weather of the forest seems to take away all of our uncertainties—like a desert in the flooding pool of thoughts. 
<br>
<br>However, it has a distinct impact on Gaia. She solely immersed herself into nature and that's sensible to me. Giving her momentum for herself would never diminish the affection that we have. 
<br>
<br>I deliberately eased my steps so I could adore her from behind. 
<br>
<br>Her hair trembled against the dancing wind, shoulders stiffened from penning in the diary, and fingers occasionally snapping as she ran out of words. The picturesque scene compliments her loveliness.
<br>
<br>It was often like that, me admiring from behind and her writing in a diary. An idea mingled my mentality and I tried to behave differently to add a touch of color to our monochromatic love story. 
<br>
<br>My steps grew bigger and silent, walking in total stillness. I was barely a few inches from her when I peeked at what she was writing, just in time when her direction changed. Unable to stop, on the spur of the moment, my face planted on the forest floor. 
<br>
<br>"Zoren!" 
<br>
<br>Gaia scooted me, examining if I cracked my nose, leaving behind her diary. 
<br>
<br>"What are you trying to do? Lengthen your holiday?" she said, eyebrows nearly forming a one-liner headline.
<br>
<br>I chuckled at the thought.
<br>
<br>"My curiosity peaked, so I tried to take a look," I confessed. "Perhaps, your diary knows you better than me."
<br>
<br>I slumped my head trying to earn her sympathy. The annoyance on her face gradually melts. 
<br>
<br>"Have you forgotten that your charms won't work on me anymore?" She snatched her hand and grabbed her diary before walking away. 
<br>
<br>Grasping on the vines near me to support myself in standing up, beads of blood drip into the floor. The thorns in the vines must have impaled a wound on my hand. 
<br>
<br>I trembled in fear, the mere sight of blood reminded me of my most terrible nightmares. Gaia rushed beside me and wrapped my hands with her embroidered handkerchief. She gently pats my back and after a few moments, my breathing calms down.
<br>
<br>She worriedly embraced me and gave a slight peck on my cheeks, "Are you alright?" 
<br>
<br>My lips curled into a smile to show her that I am alright but she kept her close distance— refusing to believe in me.
<br>
<br>"I assume one true love's kiss can make me feel better?" I said provocatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I thought she would not take it seriously, but she closed her eyes and slowly approached my lips. I could feel my ears reddening, anticipating her kiss. But seconds have passed and I heard her footsteps running away. 
<br>
<br>I shook my head laughing before chasing her into the trails of an open field. We run around like little kids without a single care in the world. 
<br>
<br>Hiding behind a tree, before she runs free to the meadow. I caught her in my arms, slamming ourselves into a pile of newly reaped mows of Hays. We laughed and laughed until no sound could be heard.
<br>
<br>I arched my back to curl beside her like the birds above us, flying so freely. Unknowingly, my gentle lips silently searched her forehead, planting a light feathered kiss.
<br>
<br>“What are you? A leading man in a romantic film,” Gaia asks as I brush the stray hair mingling on her flushed cheeks. “A penny for your thoughts?”
<br>
<br>My lips rose into a smile willfully ignoring her question. She swiftly wrapped her arms around me and rested her head on my fine broad shoulders. I could feel thousands of horse battalions race inside my chest. Relentless woman! Manipulating her charms against me.
<br>
<br>"You know I do not need to be Romeo or Jack," I whispered. "I will always burn for you, in every way you’ll crave." 
<br>
<br>There she began to laugh her heart out as I stared at the blazing sun impeccably shining at her comely hubristic face. Looking at her was like a glimpse of the sun in the stormy night, a pond of water in the middle of a dessert, and sometimes an unavoidable sin. Her beauty blends with the fragrance of lilac filling up the air. 
<br>
<br>"I am writing random thoughts like the species of tree and how I fall in love with you every single day," she said out of nowhere.
<br>
<br>"Hm?" I asked, not realizing what she is pertaining to.
<br>
<br>Her eyes met mine, "My diary. You said you wanted to know what's in it. I’m also thinking of a specific item in my bucket list before I marry you."
<br><br>She stretched her hand towards the sky, fingers dreaming for the sun.
<br>
<br>I did not reply but stretched my hand before intertwining our fingers. I know she knows what I wanted to say. It was a connection that only true lovers can approximate.
<br>
<br>This was the right place to be, lying beside her on the same ground, breathing the same air.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">"Hey! Have you turned into stone?" Someone shouted in my ears while hitting my shoulders.
<br>
<br>I was summoned into reality, startled by the sunlight hitting my face. Still lying on the same ground, but breathing alone. The shadows of trees are supposed to cast shade upon me. But no trees can grumble when someone flares a piece of glass near my cheek, pouring sunlight into my sights. 
<br>
<br>I bat his hand away in fright. Standing up, my eyes wandered around thinking what has brought this man here. 
<br>
<br>"I didn't know great dreams come from sleeping beside a grave, huh?" a guy said, retracting his left hand to his pocket while the other tucked behind him. But the wind blew furiously, and I caught sight of a bright ribbon, dangling.
<br>
<br>Gaia’s diary.
<br>
<br>It seems like the wicked man who led me to the cemetery’s entrance a few hours ago has found his way to make me go ballistic.
<br> 
<br>"Give it back," I said, striving to calm down.
<br>
<br>"You were smiling at your dreams. Tell me what is it?" he said, flipping the pages instead of giving it back to me. The longer his hands cradled each page, the more my blood boiled.
<br>
<br>"Was it about Gaia? Is this her grave—" he said, but he wasn't able to finish his sentence as soon as I landed my fist into his face.
<br>
<br>"Do not dare speak her name," I hissed, grabbing the diary out of his hands. The wind grew quiet as the man warily touched his swollen lip, nonetheless—he turned to me and smiled oddly.
<br>
<br>"Geez, hold your horses! I'm just fooling around," he swiped off the beads of blood dripping from the cut on his lips. "My apologies. Sined, by the way."
<br>
<br>I ignored his hand, spreading to shake mine. Does he expect to be on my sound side? Bark at the moon, prick.
<br>
<br>He was undoubtedly up to something when I saw him grinning like a Cheshire cat before putting his hands in the air as he began to walk away. My eyes darted at him once again before wiping off his filthy fingerprint in the front cover of Gaia's diary.
<br>
<br>"Gaia…"
<br>
<br>The sky above, when I last called her, was still a secular mix of cerulean-grey cumulus clouds. Winter, after that, stifles it all, leaving me behind. Miserable and a loner.
<br>
<br>His blood left traces on the ground but to my surprise, the sight of blood did not make me tremble in fear. Most days I never had a decent sleep, I would wake up in the middle of the night fretting from my nightmares.
<br>
<br>I realized this was my best dream in a long while, the thought made me smile.
<br>
<br>"Wait, did she seriously write a bucket list here?" I stated, bemused by my reminiscent dream.
<br>
<br>This would be my first time reading her diary despite carrying it every day. She left this in my possession when this was the last thing she held. 
<br>
<br>Scanning through the pages, a two folded piece of envelope paper falls on the loamy floor. I bent over to inspect it.
<br>
<br>I swore if Sined tore down any pages in here, all hell breaks loose.

<br>
<br>I remembered how her eyebrows met whenever I cracked a corny joke. The taste of her lips after my tiring workdays. Her sweet fragrance and my smoky cigarettes at our sunlit balcony. And how her face brightens up while telling me how badly she wanted to fulfill her bucket list. 
<br>
<br>My heart broke at all the things I could never do. Bawling all the words choked up in my rough throat, to all and to no one. 
<br>
<br>But to Gaia … this tiny list on a crumpled piece of paper.<br><br>"I will do it for you," I said, bringing her diary to my chest, realizing what my dreams meant.<br></p>
