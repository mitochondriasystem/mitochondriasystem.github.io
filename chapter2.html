                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">My heart is roaring, but I don’t know where to start.<br>
<br>I fumbled with the piece of paper Gaia slipped in her diary after all these years, re-reading it over and over again. Something nicked at the back of my head, what did she really mean when she wrote this? I can’t commune with the dead, so it puzzled me even more.<br>
<br>‘1. I want to meet Zoren even more. Simple conversations, to get to know him always.’
<br><br>I bundled my worries for the moment and trekked for the entrance. The trees whispered their discussions as background noises for my thoughts. In the distance, I spotted the towering white gate of the cemetery where Sined stood idly. A dark cat sidles a purr beside the redhead’s leg, as if he has found his match. A pair of cunning fiends.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I was prepared to ignore him to maintain my loosely-held composure, but he mumbled something that stopped my tracks.
<br><br>“Astral Projection. Care to know more?”
<br><br>I turned to Sined warily, he smiled as the cat purred in our silence. I can never thank him for leading the way, I can never read him because he is oddly composed, and I can never trust him because of his previous demeanor. A sickening chill ran across my neck as I recalled when he felt around Gaia’s belongings without permission. This must be one of his sadistic tricks, and I won’t fall for it.
<br><br>He pets the stray cat, “That’s probably,” he shots a sidelong glance as if to tempt me of his offer. “The only way to meet her.”
<br><br>Numerous thoughts lit my mind at that second. But to my dismay, none of them materialized as I tried my best to grasp any. I was a little frustrated, torn whether or not to take into account what he has to say. Mad or not, if it’s for Gaia…
<br><br>Nevertheless, I refused his trap and composed myself, sighing.
<br><br>I decided to head home since I felt emotionally exhausted from visiting Gaia’s grave after a long while of lacking courage, I continued my trek towards the white gate. Exiting the cemetery at noon, the cat tailed my footsteps. It nimbly dodged a puddle, reflecting its image like a mirror on the still rainwater.
<br><br>After a while, I hear no more purring. I turned to check, but it was already gone.
<br><br>—
<br><br>“This is the last stop.”
<br><br>I jolted awake as the burly driver tapped my shoulder. The vehicle shook at his heavy steps, probably annoyed at me. I muttered my apologies and promptly exited the transport, being extra careful as I nearly tipped over, steadying my feet on the sidewalk. After all, it was late and my spirits were getting increasingly sleepy each second.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Raising my head, hoping to alleviate my slumber, I saw the midnight sky disheveled in its array of twinkling lights. I’ve grown acquainted with the sight. The week had been increasingly long and my students were already concerned about me. Normally they’d brush off my dullness, thinking it’s what came along as I taught a boring subject. But today, they noticed something off.
<br><br>I couldn’t agree with them more.
<br><br>But it was for good reason, and I thanked their concern. I try to find my way home on the dimly lit road, walking towards the destination with a growing weariness.
<br><br>The bags under my eyes deepened at every attempt in discovering Astral Projection. During each experiment, I felt a growing lethargy that I couldn’t quite name. It is as though my energy was taken away from me in small increments. Regardless, meditation and philosophy aren’t my strong suits—that was Gaia’s thing, and  perhaps that was why we complemented each other.
<br><br>Ambling towards my apartment, I deftly opened the door and prepared a cup of coffee. The steaming smell of caffeine lingered in the dark corridors of my room.
<br><br>Instinctively, my eyes traced the light of the moon at the balcony. Perhaps expecting her ghost to scold me for drinking coffee at such a late hour. However, no matter what I do, I could not find it in my conscience to stop. I have to succeed.
<br>I took a swig of the warm liquid. Now, energized for another night of investigation.
<br><br>It had only occurred to me that the lights were off, but it didn’t matter as I opened my laptop and proceeded to scroll through the online articles I had bookmarked in my spare time. Engrossed in the search, the clacking of the keyboard echoed through the night. Now and then a cold breeze wafts, exuding shivers down my neck.
<br><br>But this time, it wasn’t the wind.
<br><br>My eyes could not believe the digital blurbs of text written on the bright screen. I took a deep breath and pinched the bridge of my nose out of disbelief, before mouthing the words before me.
<br><br>“Astral Projection is an occultic method, only matched when the doer promises death.”
<br><br>Even before tackling the concept, I thought I had already prepared myself for the worst. But if I were to believe it, would I be mad? Doubts loomed my mind. It’s a matter I can’t simply chat away to someone, they would think it’s preposterous. But the thought of Gaia grounds my senses, and before I grow demented at my exhaustion, another sip of coffee stirred me to my objective.
<br><br>I read slowly to pace myself, taking every bit of information in the article. After a long while, my eyes struggled to focus. It’s probably time for some shut-eye.
<br><br>Readying my bed, my consciousness faded into a mindless state. The exhaustion from reading complemented the tenacity to complete Gaia’s last wish. I closed the balcony which drew a chilling draft and proceeded to sit on the cushy pillows. Wanting for my mind to clear, the words and terms of everything I’d been investigating only clouded my mind like a thick fog of disarray.
<br><br>I chanted words from the articles solemnly like uttering a prayer, helplessly grasping at my sanity.<br>
<br>The sheets on my duvet wrinkled as I lie to comprehend the absurdity.
<br><br>I closed my lids with my teeth clenched from a noiseless pain. I breathed, swearing I was in midair. And once I open my eyes—a ghastly spiral of dust loomed above.
<br><br>With gritted teeth, I entered.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">It was like looking through a mirror.
<br><br>My jaw dropped in awe as an image of a dazzling city bathed in monochromatic lights assembled at my feet. It took a moment to process I was somewhere else, but how could such a thing happen? The passersby clad in an ethereal glow gasped at the sight of me. Soon enough, it dawned on me why I feel so out of place in my body, and why everyone around me seemed pale and ghoulish. Did I pass the portal? Have I succeeded? Is this the Astral Realm?
<br><br>I pinched myself, but I didn’t wake up.
<br><br>The throb of my exhaustion was miraculously absent, so I took the opportunity to make the most of my liveliness. My hands were still trembling from excitement and disbelief. I still can’t fathom that I’m in a different realm, and the possibility of witnessing Gaia’s sweet personage and soothing voice beckoned me to cut through the pale crowds of wandering spirits.
<br><br>I wasn’t aware that I can piss someone off in the afterlife, but this is the least of my concerns as I have probably aggravated a number of them already.
<br><br>My hysteria wore off, and I took a minute to compose myself in a nearby forest at the edge of the ghoulish city.
<br><br>It wasn’t like the cemetery where Gaia was buried, somehow even more pale and lifeless as graveyards could be. The wind is stagnant in the Astral Realm, and I found myself breathing heavily for a gasp of air. I was starting to think of whether a living human is even allowed to be here, and how long I can survive, but an odd being with silver hair greeted me in the heart of the woods before the worry settled in.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“I’ve been here a lot for making deals,” it bellowed.
<br><br>I turn away, startled. Up until now, all the entities I’ve encountered scampered away as if I’m untouchable. But here it stood walking closer, dark eyes piercing my soul.
<br><br>“I know who you’re looking for, Zoren,” its voice is sharp and cunning.
<br><br>Despite feeling small, I grew curious, “Who are you… And how do you know me?”
<br><br>The entity crossed its arms and etched a crooked smile across its face, “I suppose there’s no use in hiding. I’m just a good ol’ reliable demon, and I’ve been observing the ruckus you made at the capital. Make a deal with me and I’ll lead you to her.”
<br><br>Its wicked smile turns confident, spreading its pallid fingers to shake mine.
<br><br>The reality of the situation dawned on me. If it’s been observing me for a while, why didn’t it reveal itself the moment I materialized into this realm? <br>
<br>I dread moments I do not have discernment for—moments like these. Then again, it’s not like anyone who attempted crossing realms will openly share its truth to the real world. Else, they’d be entitled to a mentally ill crowd for the rest of their lives. Preparing my mind for the inevitable, I mentally took note of the fact that I can never tell anyone about this realm and this demon. <br>
<br>Suddenly, it retracted its hand and casted an irritated expression, “I’ll take your silence as a no. But this might convince you.”
<br><br>It stepped back, and I instinctively raised my arms to my chest. The trees stirred and the being shifted into another amalgamation. Its skin morphed into a tanned shade as its silver hair turned red, and its tall physique dwarfed into a familiar redhead’s form.
<br><br>“I already told you I know how to do it, and I never lie.”
<br><br>I gaped, breathing his name in a bewildered whisper, “Sined?”
<br><br>The cunning demon and the gatekeeper of the cemetery chuckled while offering once more, “So, how about it?”
<br>His hand reached for the space between us, spreading to await my decision.
<br><br>I observed Sined warily, his smile as sinister as a cat. I can never thank him for leading the way, I can never read him because he is oddly composed, and I can never trust him because of his previous demeanor. But I am horrified at the thought of letting Gaia slip away.
<br><br>Again.
<br><br>My body tenses, but I solidified my resolve. The demon smirks as if saying things went the way he intended.&nbsp;<br></p>
