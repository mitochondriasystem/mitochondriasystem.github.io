                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The bathroom lights flickered above Zoren’s head, inflicting a stray form of luminosity to his surroundings. It was pitch dark and silent, except for the gushing wind which brushed over the city streets. A tremendous cloud is suspended atop the city.
<br>
<br>"It's ludicrous how mortals could be easily deceived. Lies for love." 
<br>
<br>'Love is for the foolish,' a hissing voice echoes.
<br>
<br>Zoren stood alone across the mirror, closely watching himself. He was acting strange since the time that he had awakened. Although one couldn't explain if this was the natural aftermath of discovering an out-of-body experience. Nonetheless, something about him was dastardly erroneous. As though he had become a source of dark, enigmatic, and terrifying energy.
<br>
<br>"The great Astradae has escaped death once more! Didn't we?" 
<br>
<br>'We did.’
<br>
<br>And there was Zoren’s voice. His vicious laugh grumbled like a sound drawn from the pits of hell. But overall, his deep doe orbs and fair skin remained. That enough, would confirm that he was the same old brunet even if he wasn’t. <br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Across his reflection, you would see a completely different creature— a dark ball of gas with nothing but scowling eyes. It was the true form of Astradae, the demonic seeker of soulless bodies who trapped travelers by offering them their hearts' greatest desire. Then, chaining their souls under the ocean of Asphodel. Oftentimes, they lure humans to their world by shifting into human forms like its life-like disguise, Sined.
<br>
<br>"Good thing, he had no will to live. It makes our vessel powerful enough to create another portal.”
<br>
<br>Zoren begins to mumble spells, billowing the black smoke with his red eyes out of the mirror. 
<br>
<br>The scene before him was something that only happened in horror films. Every whip of his left hand the more the black smoke inside the mirror expanded. As though every word he uttered were calling the demons to come out of their den and sow terror. 
<br>
<br>After a while, he stopped whispering enchantments. Zoren's eyes turn bloodshot, opening up as Astradae's wicked glare. Grasping for water to wash his face, squinting his eyes to rub them. A glint of a razor caught his sights. Reaching for it amidst the toiletries, slashing a deep, dripping wound on his palm.
<br>
<br>He licked the dripping blood coming from his hands before pulling a piece of torn paper from Gaia’s diary out of his pocket. Clenching it in his fist before flicking it into the sink. Astradae laughed maniacally, echoing his victory.
<br>
<br>But just as the wicked devil thought he had succeeded in possessing Zoren's body, a wish appeared on the wet sheet. Before the water in the sink could completely blur the ink on the paper, Astradae screamed in pain.
<br>
<br>The wound on his hand grew bigger and the pain became unbearable. Astradae writhed and had gone berserk from the agony. The black smoke inside of him evaporated until he lost his consciousness, knocking him out on the cold and hard floor.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-10">
                
                
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">My hands and feet made no effort to escape the eternal abyss. I saw the shimmer of sunlight rippling on the water above, mocking me, scoffing at how weak I had become. Eyes wide open, I snatched my last breath. Silently groaning as I let a thousand hands below drag me towards the bottom of the ocean. 
<br>
<br>I'm scared to death. 
<br>
<br>My concern of dying was long gone in my mind, although not as much as how I fear to be saved. Opening up my eyes to witness them dying while, I—who was invited by Death, have escaped from its grip again. Stolen lives in exchange for mine. I cast away the world that didn't truly belong to me and the blame was for no one but myself. I painted my hands with their blood and I couldn't bear it anymore. Death has always been cruel to me, finding every way to save and kill me at the same time. 
<br>
<br>The clock ticked; I know that when the coldness rushes in, I'll be more than nothing. A floating scrap of seaweed, perhaps bones and flesh, decaying in the currents of the ocean. Yet, the thought makes my fragile human heart, beat. Even for just a second. The idea of death, the feeling of slowly dying was nothing more than the hope of being with Gaia. The agony that had once burned like a fire had disappeared into an icy numbness. Black filled the edges of my vision and the only thing I could hear was my own heart slowly losing its rhythm.  
<br>
<br>I perceived no saving but to shuffle off this mortal coil. At last! I shall be reunited with everyone who died because of me. Finally, I will no longer be miserable and a loner, but a Zoren beside his Gaia. 
<br>
<br>I closed my eyes, tightly shut. My soul submerged deeper into the ocean. 
<br>
<br>'Breathe.'
<br>
<br>A voice whispered near my ears and warm hands wrapped around me. The movements cause the still water to weave about. 
<br>
<br>'Breathe, Zoren.'
<br>
<br>Gentle warm lips brush against mine, giving my lungs a taste of air. This familiar kiss made me forget that I need no saving. 
<br>
<br>'Keep breathing and fulfill my last wish.'
<br>
<br>Our lips parted. The angelic voice subsiding and the presence was no longer nearby, but it kept echoing inside my head. 
<br>
<br>I blinked my eyes open and saw a monstrous mass of smoke approaching me like a storm.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>
<br>But the motion of water circled around, the whirlpool was sucking me. A violent whiplash beat my body in every direction, my throat hacking roughly as I lost even more oxygen. Suddenly, my stomach turned upside down and I found myself coughing on the chilly tiles of my bathroom.                                           
<br>
<br>Minutes passed before my lungs trusted me that I would not betray them again. My body was shivering in coldness even though I was dry. Then, I noticed a piece of paper clenched inside my fist. Strangely, my instincts were telling me to read it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">My skin was all reddish and warm as the sunlight took a toll on my features. The distance I was running was not that far. But with trembling muscles, I ought to take a break for a short while. Few students passed by and greeted me. It has been a year since my out-of-this-world experience and deal from the seeker. I never thought that the seeker had been chained under the ocean of Asphodel which he created himself. At first, it was not easy to open up to people, but they were very welcoming. This previous term I decided to stop teaching online and instead go back to the previous school I worked at.
<br>
<br>I passed by the Conor Bridge but the bench under the lamp post was nowhere to be found. It was replaced by a row of plants that most passers-by water during their morning jogs. A black beautiful butterfly landed on my right shoulder, resting its exhausted wings. 
<br>
<br>This metamorphosis reminded me of my conversation with Mr. Jose. A black beautiful butterfly who became the bridge to Gaia's death. 
<br>
<br>"Snow never depicted happiness to me. It was always a disaster, but it became one of my favorite days when I finally got to see my ring on her," I said, remembering my last few moments with Jose when I visited his prison cell. 
<br>He attempted to whisper, but seemed to lack the words after a long guilty silence. Once he collected himself, he could only tremble as he pleaded.
<br>
<br>"It was snowing that day, I am heading back to my house. I just got out of the courtroom. My wife, who decided to divorce me, got custody of my kids... Everything went blank as I watched my life taken right in front of me. Everything seemed to have lost its direction as my wheels were, but believe me... the car crash. It was all my fault!" he reached for my hands, pleading for forgiveness. 
<br>
<br>I did not reply but I gave him a sympathetic look before leaving his prison cell. I hope somehow and someday I will find a space in my heart to forgive him. But for now, I’m the one who needs healing and forgiveness from myself.
<br>
<br>The butterfly in my shoulder bids its goodbye, flying around my head before taking its departure and the memory away. The familiar white gate stood in front of me casting shade against the peak of the sun. I enter, the gentle wind welcoming me.
<br>
<br>This is where her body lies but not her soul. Back then, I kept on finding where she was without realizing that she was always with me. That she was never gone from my life as much as her love for me was. I hid in the dark, unable to forgive myself for the death of my father and Gaia. Not only once, but countless times I wished for death to knock upon my door. And it did, but I realized sometimes we never really wish to be gone.
<br>
<br>But to be found. 
<br>
<br>Realizing that I never lost Gaia, it was I who was lost along the way. A year has already passed and I can't still entirely say that I have found myself. I know it will take a life-long process but I am determined to free myself from the sorrows I never wished to happen. 
<br>
<br>The trees were wobbling in the direction of the wind and the birds sang along to the tune of the dried leaves I strode on. Step by step, I feel a huge weight being lifted from my heart. There are no more lumps to swallow, I breathe freely. Finding her once again at the heart of the forest, swirling and catching the falling leaves as her hair bounces. She stopped when she saw me approaching her before showing a bright smile. Gaia will always depict a blooming rose living free in the stretches of the field. 
<br>
<br>Indeed, time flies so fast. Our day was spent doing my casual routine every time I visited her. Such as I would tell her stories on how my students tried to make fun of me, or what happened to my trip to Paris or sometimes, singing her favorite song 'Snowman'. 
<br>
<br>Sunset is only a preamble to dawn, and its grace fills my mind with the most beautiful dreams.
<br>
<br>“I’ll keep breathing, until death comes on my way again to meet me.” I kissed her grave for the last time. "And that's when fate would let us collide again."
